2D Array traversal

we have to go through arrays in 2 ways to find the furthest points and log the steps it takes to get there
each step has to know where he comes from so we dont go back

| x array before same index or after same index
- x element before or after
L x array before same index & element after
J x array before same index & element before
7 x array after same index & element before
F x array after same index & element after
. x nothing
S x Unknown

To find S we have to check its before after array before and array after on the same index
it has 2 connecting neighbors and if we find them we can figure out what S its

Sort Input into arrays per line
Find array and index of S
Figure out S surroundings to define S and its neighbors to know in which directions to start

Start array loop in the first direction we should have a function that does the right thing depending on the tile we encounter
and the direction we came from which is also the direction we cant go to 

after going one full loop we have the length of the loop thus the farthest away point at 1/2 of the loops length

/// PART 2

We create a new map from the input and sort every '.' into it

Key: Index, Value: I

We traverse the maze in a clockwise and check for '.' with the following rules and if we find a '.' we give the index in the map the value O

Right > Above O Bottom I
Bottom > Right O Left I
Left > Below O Top I
Top > Left O Right I

Rewrite so that all that arent true just fill out O so we can count dots that are inside
