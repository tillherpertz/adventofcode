Create Array for seeds we have

create objects for
    - soil
    - fertilizer
    - water
    - light
    - temperature
    - humidity

{
    name
    Objects
}

each object has an amount of objects with ranges

object {
    mapname (soil, seed w/e)
    src-range: (2nd number)
    dest-range: (1st number)
    range: (3rd number)
}

so we take the seed from initial seed array and check the next object soil if the number is inside a 
range = 2nd number + 3rd number

if its not in a a range of that object it is equal to itself????

that is then the number we use for the next check, a function could return that so we dont have all the other
useless shit to worry about

we check again, maybe with a counter to see how far we are we always have to check 7 objects until we get a value


/// PART 2

turning around
check from location 1 through the objects and if one end seed is inbetween the range we good?

we take the initial seed range and check the next map for its ranges
we split the seed range into more ranged depending on if they fit into a range or not, the ranges we split into just change like the mapping would have them change

we continue until we come out with a range of locations we log that range and take the smallest from those ranges
