each number of a line gets put into an object containing
    the number,
    the line before it appeared on
    and the line after it appeared on
    the first index of the number + 1 
    the last index of the number + 1
    information if it is a "part number"

for every object we now parse the whole input
and check the lines stored in the input if they have a symbol in the range

in the end sum up all the part numbers and ignore the ones that arent
